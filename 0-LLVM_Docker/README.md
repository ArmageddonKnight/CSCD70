# LLVM Docker Image

This folder contains the LLVM *Docker* image which you could use to run experiments or build examples in any OS.

## Introduction

*Docker* runs our applications in a **lightweight** *container* by using the *image* that has all the necessary software components installed.

Compared with the virtual machine solution, *Docker* has very low performance overhead ("*The general result is that Docker is **nearly identical to Native performance** and faster than KVM in every category*" as per the performance study [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26149994/6320608)).
